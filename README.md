## Features
### User-friendly dashboard

The dashboard allows the event committees to see participants' registration status and manually check-in participants when needed.

### Easy check-ins for physical events
![Screenshot of checkin](/screenshots/checkin.jpg)

Event committees at the registration counter will scan the e-tickets presented by the participants to do the check-in. This removes the need to manually write down the details (e.g. name, email, check-in time, etc.) and streamlines the check-in process.

### Automated ticket generator & sender
The system takes in the list of participants and generates e-tickets and sends the tickets to the participants through WhatsApp or email. This is the repository for the web dashboard, which doesn't include the code for the ticket generator. You can find the code for the generator in [this other repository](https://github.com/rmrt1n/sigcm-ticket-generator).
